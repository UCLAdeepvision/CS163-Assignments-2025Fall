# Assignment 4

Welcome to our fourth assignment!

### Access
You can open the assignment by downloading the notebook [(25F_CS163_Assignment4.ipynb)](./25F_CS163_Assignment4.ipynb) locally and upload it to Google [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

### Goals
In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to explore three popular generative models for different applications:

1. Autoregressive Models and RNNs
2. Diffusion Models


Through this assignment, you will be building an image-captioning model that generates text descriptions given image inputs and visualizes the attention weights. You will also gain experience in building a diffusion model to generate images and understanding the state-of-the-art StableDiffusion text-to-image diffusion model.

As always, please feel free to post any questions or issues you encounter on the Piazza forum. And remember, please do not directly copy code from other sources.

This assignment is due on ***Sunday, Dec 7***.

**Do not use any Code AI to finish the assignment.**

❗**Once you have finished all the questions, it will still take approximately *60 minutes* to re-run the entire notebook in order to prepare the submission version. Make sure to allocate enough time for this task and start early.**

### Submission
Submit the completed notebook to BruinLearn. Make sure you have completed all the code implementations with all the results printed(marked as **Your Implementations **), and answered all the blanks at the end of each question.

Good luck and happy coding! Remember, the most important thing is to have fun and learn something new.
